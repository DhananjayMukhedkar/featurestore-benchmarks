# Feature Store Online Write Throughput


In this benchmark, we measure the write throughput of a feature store in going from raw event data in a message bus (Kafka, Polars, etc) to a stream processing feature pipeline writing the feature values to the online feature store. 


## Benchmarked Feature Stores

The current feature stores benchmarked here are:

 * Hopsworks Feature Store

# How to run the Benchmarks
